						ASTR 230: Astronomy Laboratory at Rice University.</a>
					 I attempt to classify supernovae using instrumental magnitudes from the Hα, V, and R filters at the

				<p>
					There are two different types of supernovae, type 1 and type 2. The main distinguishing factor between the two 
					of them is that type 2 has hydrogen lines and type 1 do not. This is because the type 2 supernovae still have 
					a hydrogen envelope around them, while the type 1 have lost theirs in some way. However, there are some
					similarities in how the two types of supernovae occur.
				</p>
				<p>
					The type 1B, type 1C and type 2 supernovae are formed when a supergiants's core collapses and the resulting shock 
					wave causes them to explode into a supernova. The type 1A supernovae are also known as standard candles. They're
					white dwarves in binary systems where they are continuously stealing matter from their companion. Eventually, they
					gain so much mass that they exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, at which point they are no longer able to sustain 
					themselves using electron degeneracy. Fusion starts in their core and the dwarf explodes in a type 1A supernova.

				<p>
					Even though the type 1 supernovae have different evolution paths, they all have one thing in common: a lack of 
					hydrogen lines. The result that I expect when I compare the Hα/R ratios of the type 1 and type 2 supernovae
					is that the type 2 supernovae will have a significantly higher ratio than the type 1 supernovae. I also included
					the V/R ratio, in case it may be another factor. However, I do not expect there to be a significant difference.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to test this, I took the spectra of a typical type 1 and type 2 supernova and integrated the flux in 
					IRAF within the R and Hα bandpasses I used. I chose supernovae with z < 0.02 so that the redshift would 
					minimally affect the integration. As you can see below, the type 2 supernova has a strong Hα line where the type
					1 does not. I centered my integration at the location of the Hα line at 6563 Å. The R bandpass estimate that I 
					used was 1600 Å wide, although the actual bandpass was closer to 1200 Å wide. The Hα filter at McDonald that I 
					used was 700 Å wide, but I also integrated the flux for a 200 Å wide bandpass as that is the width of the 
					filter that we have on hand at Rice University. I did the integration for both to see if the narrower bandpass 
					would help isolate the Hα line more.

				<p>
					After doing my flux integration in IRAF, the Hα/R ratio that I got for the wider R bandpass for the type 1
					supernova was 0.505 and for the type 2 was 0.457. However, with the narrower bandpass I got 0.142 for the
					type 1 and 0.150 for the type 2. It is likely that because the McDonald R bandpass is so wide, the Hα line is
					being averaged out so that it doesn't change much in the ratio. The Hα line may look very wide in the spectra
					above, but that is because it is very zoomed in. With such a large bandpass it's not going to make as much
					of a difference in counts as I'd want it to. But with the narrower filter, I was able to get results that
					lined up more with what I expected, which is that the type 1 has a lower Hα/R ratio than the type 2. These
					supernovae were also part of my dataset, so as shown in the next section these Hα/R ratios are reflected in
					the actual data I analyzed.
