# Classifying Supernovae
This is a project for the ASTR 230: Astronomy Laboratory at Rice University. I attempt to classify supernovae using instrumental magnitudes from the HÎ±, V, and R filters at the 0.8 meter telescope at McDonald Observatory. See [this website](https://asmallsquishysquid.github.io/ClassifyingSupernovae/) for full details.
